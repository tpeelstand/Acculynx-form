# Acculynx-form
Here is a form I created for the Acculynx code challenge. It is a responsive form that works on phone, tablet and computer. Doing this form was quite fun and I enjoyed using the knowledge I already had and also learning more about flexbox and doing responsive design and development without using a framework.

For this project I used the following languages: Pug (for HTML templating), Less (my pre-prossesor), and a bit of javascript to help with creating additional form fields. 

Given a week to complete, spent a total of around 10 - 12 hours building the form mainly before and after work and a little on the weekend.

There are a few things I would enjoy completing that I did not quite have the time to do: 
  1. For mobile view I would make the Add Email & Add Phone button fix to the top so when scrolling you would be able to add fields easier. 
  2. I would add in a disable function so that when a "Primary Phone" radio is click the other radios would get a disable class added to them so the text would get greyed out and the pointer-event would get set to none.
  
One additional note:
  1. Also, I defaulted the first email to a primary email based on the title and the other emails as additional emails. This could also be done by adding a radio or something similar so that if you want you could set any email to your primary email.


As always.....feedback is welcome! Enjoy! :-)
