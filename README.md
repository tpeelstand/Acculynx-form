# Acculynx-form
Here is my form created for the Acculynx code challenge. It is a responsive form that works on phone, tablet and computer. Doing this form was quite fun and I enjoyed using the knowledge I already had and also learning more about flexbox and doing responsive design and development without a framework.

For this project I used the following code languages: Pug (for HTML templating), Less (my pre-prossesor), and a bit of javascript to help with creating additional form fields. 

Given a week to complete, but spent a total of around 10 - 12 hours building the form mainly before and after work and a little on the weekend.

If I had a bit more time I would most likely mae it so the button for adding email and phone would stay fixed to the top on the screen on a phone so it would easier to add them as you scroll down the page. I may even do this is my free time at some point....basicly because it bugs me and I don't want to leave it unfinished.

Feedback is welcome!
